        <h3>Diverse Demands, Inequitable Access</h3>
        <p>
          California’s water system is vast, but access to water isn’t equal. Some users — often the most vulnerable — face more barriers to clean and reliable water. COEQWAL asks: what if we shared the tools that shape policy, and reimagined a more equitable water future for all?

        <h3>Everyone Deserves a Voice</h3>
        <p>
          For too long, water decisions have been made behind closed doors, using models and language inaccessible to most. COEQWAL is building a public platform where anyone can explore water scenarios, challenge assumptions, and shape policy from the ground up.

        <h3>Climate Change Adds Urgency</h3>
        <p>
          Droughts, floods, and saltwater intrusion are growing threats. But communities don’t experience these risks equally. COEQWAL helps us imagine futures that center resilience, fairness, and the people who’ve historically been left behind.
